The three files deposited here allow to follow the pipeline used to carry out the analysis performed with Seurat to identify differentially expressed genes between the neuronal types of the same class. Due to the large volume of data of the different classes, we have made available to the user as an example the expression data of synaptic genes of the neuronal types within CA3 class.

Briefly, the files contain:
- annot_CA3.RDS: the metadata of the neurons belonging to CA3, where the name of the sample, the neuronal type to which it belongs, among others, are indicated.
- prot_PSD_df_CA3: the matrix with the raw expression data of each synaptic gene for the different neurons of the CA3 class.
- samps_CA3: the name of the CA3 class neurons.

The script to use for differential expression analysis is number 2 (Source_Data_2_Iteration_Types.R). The output provided (Output_Types.RDS) must be subsequently processed using the script number 4 (Source_data_4_Data_analysis_Type_CA3.R) to treat the data and be able to draw biological conclusions from the initial data, through the different tables and graphs that are generated.

Important: The Seurat package was updated to version 5 (v5) on 2024-05-10. 
Our scripts were developed to be used with version 4. More specifically we used v4.3.
Seurat v4.3 can be found here:
https://satijalab.r-universe.dev/Seurat

For optimal performance of our scripts, and for their testing, please use Seurat v4.3
